# This is Kaggle's AnimalShelter project: Help improve outcomes for shelter animals 

https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes
Brief description of this project: 
Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal(5 classes: Transfer, Adoption, Return_to_owner,Died, Euthanasia).


###This is a multiclass classification problem and metric is logLoss(multi-class logarithmic loss)
